# GameCubeMarioPartyMusicEditor

### GameCube Mario Party Music Editor
* A tool allows you to edit the music in Mario Parties 5-7

### Why not Mario Party 4?
* Simple! Most of the music in that game is sequenced, not streamed

### Note
* Music audio must be in DSP format and must have the end of the loop be the end of the song
* This is due to Mario Parties 5-7 not using end loop points

### Special Thanks
* This project wouldn't be possible without the work of Yoshimaster96. Huge props to them!
